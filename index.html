        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p><b>Changing the African Narrative</b><br>
          I hail from Kenya and defined as a Pan-Africanist angling at making Africa the preferred continent - amongst many other regions - to live, invest and prosper. Africa is a resource-rich (Natural and human) land. The biggest mines (For instance, by 2012, Africa accounted for 56% of diamond production across the globe) are buried in our motherland. Additionally, it is estimated that there shall be 2.4 billion Africans by 2050. Imagine that! Do the math and calculate the number of schools and hospitals that we can erect if we properly manage our proceeds from diamond alone. How about prudent utilization of resources from our diverse pools of cash-cows by merely eliminating corruption? Chances are that infant deaths will significantly reduce; and a healthy, prosperous and educated population shall emerge. Did you know that by 2100 Africa will account for half of the entire global population growth? Well, now you know. Mama Africa is emerging, and if properly harnessed, better yields are promised to Her sons and daughter. We are at a crossroad. A youthful, innovative, resourceful, and ambitious people want what’s rightfully theirs: a corruption-free continent with the future promised to none, but those who are ready to dirty their hands and uphold integrity. That’s what I desire. I purpose and intend to deliver such a future to my kids and grandchildren.

        <h2>INCONS</h2>
        <p><b>The African Child’s Vision</b><br>
            Mama Africa has been short-changed for so long that we need to formulate a new Narrative. A narrative of shared prosperity. A narrative of Leadership rather than of dealers. A narrative where a newborn baby has a survival chance as that of a child born in America, China; Or even, in our former colonial masters’ territory, Europe. Africa needs change, and that shall only be achieved when we as a people join hands; lift each other; hold our brothers’ and sisters’ hands in time of need; and, ultimately, say an emphatic “NO!” to dealers and charlatans masquerading as leaders. We must start to vet before we elect. The time to settle for options floated to us by pen-pushers and box-tickers has no place in a prosperous Africa. Africa is transitioning. The above is my vision for the son and daughters of Africa: CHANGING THE AFRICAN NARRATIVE.<br>
            <b>My Philosophy</b> <br>

            Ephraim Kabui Kariuki believes in the maxim, “The surest way to unite a people is through shared prosperity. Holding your brothers’ and sisters’ hands in a bid to make them the best versions of themselves."<br>

            <b>Interests</b> <br>

            Earnestly fascinated by the involvement and participation of women and youths in leadership and governance. Africa is a youthful continent, and requires multi-faceted approach in dealing with its challenges while putting in mind the long-haul view of making it "The place to be." It also goes without saying that I have a flair for fashion.<br>
